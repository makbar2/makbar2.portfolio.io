            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                I took over the development of a full-stack web application that enabled pharmacists to carry out New Medicine Service (NMS) consultations remotely. 
                The application was originally built using Node.js, Express, and a SQL database. I restructured the backend to make it more modular, added new features to both the front and backend, 
                and designed and developed the database ensuring schema was in third normal form to reduce data redundancy. I also built tools within the web-app for non-technical users 
                to audit data without directly accessing the database. JWT authentication was used to protect routes and manage access to sensitive data.
            </p>

            <h2>Technical Challenges & Solutions</h2>
            <p>
                Main challenge for developing this program was requirements gathering, as some things weren't made clear enough or features were added that weren't needed.
                One instance of this is I implemented session timing for consultations (tracking start and end times) based on early discussions about potentially recording audio.
                Although we didnâ€™t move forward with that, it taught me the importance of confirming scope early.

            <h3>Admin page</h3>
            <p>
                I needed to keep all admin tools on the same page to ensure a smooth experience (no page reloads). To achieve this:
