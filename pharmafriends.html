            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                I took over development of a full-stack web application enabling pharmacists to perform New Medicine Service (NMS) consultations remotely. 
                The app was originally built with Node.js, Express, and a SQL database. I restructured the backend by modularizing which helped with maintainabiltiy and scalabiltiy
                , improved the database design (ensuring 3NF to reduce redundancy)
                ,and added features across both front and backend.
            </p>
            <p>The application also featured:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Jwt authentication to protect routes</li>
                <li>Audit tools to allow non-technical people to audit data without having to access the database directly.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Technical Challenges & Solutions</h2>
            <p>
                Main challenge for developing this program was requirements gathering, as some things weren't made clear enough or features were added that weren't needed.
                One instance of this is I implemented session timing for consultations (tracking start and end times) based on early discussions about potentially recording audio.
                Although we didnâ€™t move forward with that, it taught me the importance of confirming scope early.
