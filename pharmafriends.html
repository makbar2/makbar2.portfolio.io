            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <P>
                PharmaFriends was a platform designed to help pharmacists conduct NMS (New Medicine Service) consultations remotely. 
                It was developed for a startup aiming to handle these consultations on behalf of independent pharmacies.
            </P>
            <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Node.js</li>
                <li>Express.js</li>
                <li>MySQL</li>
                <li>JWT Authentication</li>
                <li>Twig templating</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Role</h2>
            <p>
                I joined the project after an initial prototype had been created but required substantial development to meet the project's goals. 
                I modularized the backend, added features like role authentication using JWT,usage statistics for pharmacists and pharmacies, and admin tools to allow admins to audit 
                and modify the data without having to use the database directly, and redesigned the database in 3NF to minimize redundancy.  
                Restructuring was needed to make the program easier to maintain as more features were implemented. 
            </p>
            <h2>Decisions and Challenges</h2>
            <h3>Scope Creep</h3>
            <p>
                Main challenge for developing this program was requirements gathering, as some things weren't made clear enough or features were added that weren't needed.
                One instance of this is I implemented session timing for consultations (tracking start and end times) based on early discussions about potentially recording audio and needing accurate logs for when 
                consultations were completed, this wasn't needed and I had to remove a few hours worth of work. This taught me the importance of confirming the scope early.
            </p> 
        
            <h3>Database</h3>
            <p>
                I decided to implement the database handler as a static class, since the database is used by all the endpoints.
                Making the class static ensures a single, persistent connection logic stays in memory for the life of the server process.
            </p>
            <h3>Admin page</h3>

                <figcaption>Gif showing admin page functionality</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
               To ensure a smooth user experience without page reloads, I built all admin tools into a single page. Each tool was separated into its own Twig file and hidden by default with css. 
               When an admin selects a tool, it's shown dynamically by toggling the visibility class.
            </p>
            <h2>Outcomes & Lessons learned</h2>
            <p>
                This project highlighted the importance of clear communication with clients/stakeholders early detailed discussions about each feature could have saved significant time. 
                Although the system was technically feature-complete, stakeholders couldn't proceed to testing or deployment due to other commitments. 
                Despite the project not launching, it provided valuable experience in working with an existing codebase, designing scalable backend systems, and managing real world product ambiguity.
